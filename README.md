 # MVC Blog Project


This project was developed in 1.5 months using Asp.net MVC5, N-Tier Architecture, Repository Design Pattern, Entity Framework, and Codefirst technologies. There are 3 basic screens in the project, these are the admin, user and author interfaces. User can read blogs, comment and categorize blogs. You can also subscribe if you want. In the author section, the author can write a new blog, make edits to the blogs he wrote, see the comments made on their own blogs, and send messages to other authors or the admin. Admin can authorize category, blog, contact and all other menus. Comments can be deleted by the admin.
